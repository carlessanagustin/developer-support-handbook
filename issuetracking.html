<h1>Issue Tracking<a class="headerlink" href="#issue-tracking" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>A public web API is one of the hardest types of software to write, because your
audience is unknown and their use cases are infinite. If you are designing an
API for internal use within your company, you can pretty much understand how
they are expecting to use it and make it do what your colleagues want.  But when
you are designing an API that can be consumed by any web developer anywhere in
the world, you can predict how a good portion of those developers will use it -
but there will always be a fraction that wants to use it differently.</p>
<p>At last count, the Google Maps API is used by more than 300,000 developers. Most
of them are simply putting a map on a page, and dotting some markers on top.
But a handful of them are using it for something completely different. You could
ignore that handful, but often times, those innovative developers are the ones
that attract many users and get other developers excited about your API.</p>
<p>The basic point is this: your API is not perfect, atleast not to everyone using
it. Your API will have bugs that developers suffer from (both the obvious
cross-browser compatibility bugs, and the more subtle
its-not-what-the-developer-expected bugs) and your API will lack in features
that developers want. Developers don&#8217;t expect your API to be perfect, but they
do expect for their voice to be heard when they report a bug or request
a feature. Your developers should be helping you shape the future of your API, and
listening to their issues is a way of showing them that you care about their
feedback.  (You don&#8217;t need to implement every feature or fix every bug, but you
should listen regardless).</p>
<p>When you&#8217;re small and starting out, you can handle
this in a forum, but when you get beyond a certain threshold of developers and
bugs, you really should start using an issue tracker.</p>
<div class="section" id="issue-tracker-features">
<h2>Issue Tracker Features<a class="headerlink" href="#issue-tracker-features" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>An issue tracker is a structured way for developers to voice their needs and
wants, and it typically includes these features:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><strong>Comments</strong>: Gives other developers an opportunity to comment on the issue, to
give workarounds, additional data, or additional use cases.</li>
<li><strong>Votes</strong>: Gives other developers a way to show their support for an issue (like by
starring or voting for it.)</li>
<li><strong>Status</strong>: Gives the API team a way to change the status of issues, from Open to
Closed, and everything in between.</li>
<li><strong>Duplicates</strong>: Gives the API team a way to mark issues as duplicates of eachother,
so that all interested developers are subscribing to the same issue.</li>
<li><strong>Notification</strong>: Notifies interested developers immediately when an issue is
closed (ideally by email), so that they can remove workarounds in their code
or add blocked features.</li>
<li><strong>Categorization</strong>: Gives the API team a way to categorize the issues to make it
easier to find issues affecting different aspects of the API.</li>
<li><strong>Search</strong>: Gives everyone a way to search and sort for issues that may be
relevant to them.</li>
<li><strong>Statistics</strong>: Gives the API team a way to visualize which issues are the most
important to developers, to help them prioritize their internal roadmap
accordingly.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are various public and open-source issue tracking systems,
and many of them are related to either forum software or source code repository
hosting software. You can often choose to only use the issue tracking aspect,
however. Some popular ones are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.atlassian.com/software/jira/">JIRA</a>: A full-featured issue tracker which can also be used for project
tracking.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.github.com">Github</a>: A git source host that includes simple but nearly full-featured
issue tracking for each repository.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/">Google Code Project Hosting</a>: A code project host that includes issue
tracking for each project. Similar to Github issue tracking, but with
more customization and statistics.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://www.bugzilla.org/">Bugzilla</a>: A full-featured and open-source issue tracker, created by
Mozilla and used by their products.</li>
<li><a class="reference external" href="http://trac.edgewall.org/">Trac</a>: A full-featured and open-source issue tracker which can be
connected to a subversion repository if desired.</li>
</ul>
<p>For Google APIs, we always use <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/">Google Code Project Hosting</a>, so I am the most
familiar with that. Read below for an in-depth discussion of setting up
a Google Code issue tracker.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="issue-handling-guidelines">
<h2>Issue Handling Guidelines<a class="headerlink" href="#issue-handling-guidelines" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Regardless of which issue tracker you choose and what features it has,
you should take care in responding to issues in a timely manner and
reacting to issues in a way that benefits your API.</p>
<div class="section" id="responding-to-issues">
<h3>Responding to Issues<a class="headerlink" href="#responding-to-issues" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>When you have an issue tracker for a product, you should make sure to be
responsive to it on a regular basis. If you don&#8217;t respond to filed issues,
developers will feel once again that they&#8217;re filing bugs into an abyss, and
you&#8217;re back at square one. A good response rate to maintain is weekly - i.e. all
new issues are responded to within a week of filing. There are a few ways to
make sure of this.</p>
<div class="section" id="email-filters">
<h4>EMail Filters<a class="headerlink" href="#email-filters" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>When a new issue comes into my GMail inbox, I set filters so that it is
automatically labeled as an issue for a particular API (Maps, Wave, etc). If I
see that the issue is very easy to respond to (like if its a duplicate or a
misdirected issue), then I may immediately respond. If not, I add the tag
&#8220;TRIAGE-LATER&#8221; and archive it. I have GMail setup using the multiple inboxes
lab, so that the &#8220;TRIAGE-LATER&#8221; inbox is below my main one, a constant reminder
of issues that need a response. Then, I can check that label every few days at
work, and respond to the issues, in the order of oldest to newest.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="triage-meetings">
<h4>Triage Meetings<a class="headerlink" href="#triage-meetings" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>It&#8217;s not always so fun to respond to isses by your lonesome - you may not feel
confident in your answer, you may not know enough to respond, etc. When you have
the resources to do so, it can be a much better experience to triage with
colleagues.</p>
<p>On Maps API, we did triage meetings in person, and ordered the triaging by API,
so that the JS API engineer only had to be there for first bit, and the Flash
API engineer only had to be there for the last bit.</p>
<p>On Wave APIs, we conducted the triage the meetings inside a Wave, and it worked
remarkably well. Once a week, I&#8217;d start up a wave with my colleague and the API
engineering team mailing list, and paste the non-triaged issues in.
Then, my colleague and I would pick a bug, indicate in the wave that we&#8217;re
looking at it, converse about it for a bit, and indicate when we&#8217;d responded to
it. By doing it in one wave, we were able to multi-task. I could work on a bug
while still chatting with my colleague about his bug, and effectively, we get
twice the bug triaging done. If we wanted a member of the API engineering team to
give his opinion, we could bring him on the wave. We also used those meetings to
respond to unanswered forum posts, as we had a similar response time goal for
those. If there was a surge in issues in a particular week, we scheduled
additional triage meetings. Wave is now deprecated, but perhaps Google Docs
with commenting could be used in a similar way.</p>
<p>Some APIs also do their triaging over chat, IRC, etc. All that really matters is
that you are responding to issues in a timely and efficient manner, in a way
that works for you.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="reacting-to-issues">
<h3>Reacting to Issues<a class="headerlink" href="#reacting-to-issues" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>One of the benefits of an issue tracker is that its data can be used to guide
product decisions, like what bugs to fix or features to fulfill. Google Code
issue trackers have the &#8220;starring&#8221; mechanism and sort-by-starring, so it is very
easy to look at your issues and see which have been starred the most. It is also
very easy to let that guide all of your product decisions - but it is dangerous
to do so, particularly when it comes to feature requests.</p>
<p>When we first launched the Maps API for Flash, the Flash community rejoiced-
and then a few vocal developers said &#8220;But why is there no AIR support?&#8221; They
then created a feature request for AIR support and asked developers to star it
in their blogs. We saw more activity on that AIR request than on any other
request previously, and we acted on it. We went through a fair bit of
engineering effort to make our API work for AIR, and we launched it, expecting a
large response or increase in developers. This didn&#8217;t happen. Sure, a few AIR
apps trickled in over the next few months, but nothing proportional to the
amount of stars on that request.</p>
<p>So, you need to be careful when evaluating feature requests. You need to pay
attention to whether an issue was blogged or linked by someone - that will
distort the # of stars. You need to decide if this is a feature request that
developers feel they &#8220;deserve to have&#8221; versus a request that most developers
don&#8217;t realize they want, but will use up-the-wazoo if it existed. You also need
to decide what requests will bring in more developers versus make the current
users happier. You can use stars to guide you, certainly - but don&#8217;t let them
make the decisions for you. (As we learned the hard way).</p>
<p>On the other hand, it is quite useful to use stars to guide your bug fixes
timeline, as those numbers aren&#8217;t often distorted. For example, if a developer
files a bug, and no other developer stars that other bug for months, then you
can probably safely assume that the bug is a very-low-priority or wont-fix. If a
developer files a regression bug, and 10 other developers star it on the same
day, then there is a good chance that it is a high-priority bug. You should keep
in mind which bugs are preventing further development and which bugs have viable
workarounds - you may even want to label an issue with &#8220;Workaround-True&#8221; to make
it easy to visualize that. As much as it sucks, developers are used to working
around issues (especially on the web), and are often happy if they have an
easy-to-implement workaround. If there&#8217;s none at all- well, you better get that
fix in stat.</p>

<div class="section" id="google-code-issue-tracker">
<h2>Google Code Issue Tracker<a class="headerlink" href="#google-code-issue-tracker" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When I started at Google, we did not use issue trackers for any of our APIs,
and I soon realized that we really needed to. After trying a few custom
solutions, I discovered <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/">Google Code Project Hosting</a> and created the
<a class="reference external" href="http://gmaps-api-issues.googlecode.com">Maps API issue tracker</a>. Nowadays, most every Google API
has an associated Google Code issue tracker.</p>
<p>The Google Code issue trackers are full-featured, including:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Commenting</li>
<li>Labels</li>
<li>Templates</li>
<li>Starring</li>
<li>Email Notification</li>
<li>RSS feeds</li>
<li>Custom Search &amp; Sort</li>
<li>Full Read/Write HTTP API</li>
<li>Wiki Pages</li>
</ul>
<p>They are both simple in their interface, but through the ability
to specify custom labels and templates, they can be customized to support
a wide variety of APIs. I&#8217;ve written up my customization tips here.
You should also read through the <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/support/wiki/IssueTracker">Issue Tracker official documentation</a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="setup">
<h3>Setup<a class="headerlink" href="#setup" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you&#8217;re going to use a Google Code issue tracker, here&#8217;s a walkthrough of
configuring it, with an explanation of what I&#8217;ve configured and why.
Most of the following can be configured in the &#8220;Administer-&gt;Issue Tracking&#8221;
control panel.</p>
<div class="section" id="labels">
<h4>Labels<a class="headerlink" href="#labels" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>A &#8220;label&#8221; is basically metadata about an issue in the form of a label name and
value - e.g. &#8220;ApiType-JavaScript&#8221;, &#8220;Type-Defect&#8221;. The issue trackers come with a
set of suggested labels, based on those commonly used in software projects, but
you can also suggest your own custom labels. When you use labels on issues, you
can then search and sort by labels, and link to those results (e.g. all open
Maps API bugs). Basically, labels are everything, and the more you use and
customize labels, the more useful your issue tracker will become.</p>
<div class="section" id="status-label">
<h5>Status label<a class="headerlink" href="#status-label" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>One label has a bit of a special status - and that is, conveniently, the
&#8220;Status&#8221; label. This label indicates to the issue tracker whether an issue is
open or closed, and that affects the searchability of an issue. By default,
searches are only performed on open bugs, as typically users aren&#8217;t affected by
fixed bugs. So, the issue tracker lets you designate the various values that
equate to open versus closed.</p>
<p>The default status values are shown below:</p>
<p><img alt="statusdefault" src="_images/screenshot_issuetracking_statusdefault.png" /></p>
<p>After using those defaults for a while, I quickly realized that they didn&#8217;t
quite work for my needs. Here are the status values that I use in the <cite>Google
Maps API issue tracker</cite>:</p>
<p><img alt="openclosed" src="_images/screenshot_issuetracking_openclosed.png" /></p>
<p>Here are the changes I made and why:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>&#8220;Accepted&#8221; -&gt; &#8220;Acknowledged/Confirmed&#8221;: The default values only contained one
way of saying &#8220;Yes, we&#8217;ve seen this issue and noted it as a real issue,&#8221; and
that value was &#8220;Accepted.&#8221; This worked fine for bugs, but not for feature
requests. Developers thought that &#8220;Accepted&#8221; meant that we were actually taking
on the feature request, and wondered why it was taking so long to fulfill their
requests - when in fact, we simply meant to say that it was a valid request, and
that we might fulfill it one day, given substantial resources and evidence of
its of its utility to other developers. So, we now use &#8220;Confirmed&#8221; for bugs,
after replicating the bug ourselves, and &#8220;Acknowledged&#8221; for feature requests,
after deciding it is a valid request for the scope of our API, and confirming it
isn&#8217;t fulfilled in some other way (like by an open source library). Anecdotally,
I believe this has led to less developers feeling teased.</li>
<li>&#8220;NeedsMoreInfo&#8221;: Oftentimes, a developer posts what sounds like a valid bug, but
doesn&#8217;t provide enough information to replicate. So, we use this label to
indicate that we have reviewed the issue atleast once and are awaiting further
clarification from the developer. Once they provide enough info, it moves on to
one of the other labels. If they never provide the info after a substantial
amount of time, we can assume the bug was not important enough to them and close
it.</li>
<li>&#8220;FixedNotReleased&#8221;: Since our API code changes happen internally and are not
available for developers until the next release of the API, we can&#8217;t immediately
mark an issue as fixed when it&#8217;s fixed internally. But, in the case of a bug, I
like to let developers know that a fix is imminent, so that they can plan their
own development accordingly. And at release time, I also find it handy to have a
list of the issues that I think were fixed in that release, so that I can easily
create a changelog. I will rarely use this for feature requests, since we often
like the fulfillment of those to be a surprise. It can sometimes confuse
developers who are new to the API when they see an issue marked as
FixedNotReleased, so it can be helpful to leave a comment like &#8220;This bug has
been fixed internally and the fix is expected to go out in the next release.
Releases are weekly.&#8221;</li>
<li>&#8220;PostElsewhere&#8221;: We often get people posting requests in issue trackers that
don&#8217;t quite belong there. They either belong in a forum (i.e. it&#8217;s a developer
looking for help debugging their own code), or they belong in a different issue
tracker. When I mark an issue as PostElsewhere, I always leave a note about
where they should post their issue, and I try to be as nice as possible (to
avoid people feeling like they&#8217;re on an endlessly redirected phone call with
customer support). It can be useful to review the PostElsewhere issues every so
often to see if the messaging should be changed to reduce the number of
misdirected issues.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="predefined-custom-labels">
<h5>Predefined custom labels<a class="headerlink" href="#predefined-custom-labels" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>The issue tracker suggests the following set of predefined labels, for setting
attributes like issue type, priority, OS, etc:</p>
<p><img alt="predefineddefault" src="_images/screenshot_issuetracking_predefined_default.png" /></p>
<p>Depending on your project, you will probably end up changing most of these (or
not using them). Here&#8217;s what I came up with for the Maps API:</p>
<p><img alt="predefinedall" src="_images/screenshot_issuetracking_predefined_all.png" /></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>&#8220;Type&#8221;: I retained only the &#8220;Defect&#8221; and &#8220;Enhancement&#8221; values, as I didn&#8217;t find
a need for the others. I have contemplated changing those values to &#8220;Bug&#8221; and
&#8220;FeatureRequest&#8221; as that is the more common nomenclature these days.</li>
<li>&#8220;Component&#8221;: Most issues are about the actual API code itself, but some issues
are about related components: the documentation, and the maps data. To
distinguish those from the engineering issues, I created components for them -
&#8220;Docs&#8221; and &#8220;Data&#8221;. (And yes, I think that you should welcome developers filing
documentation bugs - documentation usability is just as important as API
usability).</li>
<li>&#8220;ApiType&#8221;: Because of the overlap across the different Maps APIs (Flash, JS,
etc) both in terms of issues and the engineering team, I decided to use the same
issue tracker for all of the APIs. To make sure I could easily distinguish the
issues (in links and searches), I created this label and its values. As a bonus,
I can assign multiple values of this label to an issue if it crosses multiple
APIs.</li>
<li>&#8220;Regression&#8221;: The worst kind of bugs are regressions. If something worked for a
developer and suddenly doesn&#8217;t work, then that is the first thing you should
fix. To make sure I can easily see what current regression issues we have, I use
this label. I typically only set the label in the case that an issue is a
regression, and then search for &#8220;Regression-Yes&#8221;.</li>
<li>&#8220;Browser&#8221;: The vast majority of the Maps API bugs are browser dependent, and I
find that many bugs in web-based projects are browser-dependent. I use this
label to designate the affected browser(s) for browser-dependent issues. I can
then search for issues that our IE 6 experts can fix (it sucks to be known as an
IE6 expert, but these things happen), and visualize the distribution of issues
to see what browser is causing us the most headaches.</li>
<li>&#8220;Internal&#8221;: This label is a bit different than the others, in that it has no
preset values. I use this label on an issue so that I can relate it to the
sister issue in our internal bug-tracking system (e.g. &#8220;Internal-1234567&#8221;).
Though it can be a bit annoying to track issues both internally and externally,
we track externally so that we can make private comments and attach code
changelists to the issue. Some of my colleagues use greasemonkey scripts or
Chrome extensions to easily visualize both internal and external data at once.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="caveat">
<h5>Caveat<a class="headerlink" href="#caveat" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h5>
<p>Only members of a project can assign labels when editing an issue. Non-members
can only leave comments or star issues. It would be handy if non-members were
allowed to assign some labels to an issue, but not others (i.e. you wouldn&#8217;t
want a non-member to mark an issue as fixed, but you would welcome them
characterizing it as an IE8 issue). You can use issue templates (described next)
to somewhat solve this need, however.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="issue-templates">
<h4>Issue Templates<a class="headerlink" href="#issue-templates" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>When a developer click &#8220;New issue&#8221; in an issue tracker, they are given a default
template to fill out, shown below:</p>
<p><img alt="templatedefault" src="_images/screenshot_issuetracking_template_default.png" /></p>
<p>This template gives standard questions for bug replication, and adds default
&#8220;Type&#8221; and &#8220;Priority&#8221; labels. Now, after you&#8217;ve created a set of labels for your
product, you will probably also want to customize this template for your own
needs, and you may also want to create more than just a bug and feature request
template. For the Maps API, I created special templates for each API, so that I
could link developers to the relevant template for their API, so that I could
assign the appropriate labels, and so that I could provide API-specific bug
reporting instructions.</p>
<p><img alt="templatemapsapi" src="_images/screenshot_issuetracking_template_mapsapi.png" /></p>
<p>Since I wanted to make sure developers used templates whenever possible, I also
modified the default generic user defect report to warn developers against using
it:</p>
<p><img alt="templategeneric" src="_images/screenshot_issuetracking_template_generic.png" /></p>
<p>You can also use templates to specify the default owner for issues, if you want
to put a particular project member in charge of triaging the issues. However,
you can accomplish a similar effect using notification filter rules (described
below).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="list-grid-view">
<h4>List &amp; Grid View<a class="headerlink" href="#list-grid-view" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The issue tracker provides various ways to visualize the issues, and numerous
configuration options for the visualization.</p>
<p>The default view is list view, and this is what the developer sees when clicking
&#8220;Issues&#8221; or doing a search.
This view shows one issue per row, and a subset of the labels as the columns.</p>
<p><img alt="listview" src="_images/screenshot_issuetracking_listview.png" /></p>
<p>When looking at a list view, the developer can further configure it by sorting
based on other columns (by clicking the arrows), or choosing to view other
columns (by clicking the &#8221;...&#8221; in the top right-hand of the header row).</p>
<p>If you want developers to see a particular sorting/labels by default (and you
probably do), you can configure that in the settings. The default is based on
the default labels:</p>
<p><img alt="listgrid" src="_images/screenshot_issuetracking_listgrid.png" /></p>
<p>You should change that depending on your project labels, and on which you think
are most important to be visualized at a glance. Here&#8217;s what I chose for the
Maps API:</p>
<p><img alt="listgridmapsapi" src="_images/screenshot_issuetracking_listgrid_mapsapi.png" /></p>
<p>Note that both the default options and my options specified that the sorting is
by stars. That means that the most starred issues will be at the top. This is
both a blessing and a curse - it means that developers looking for common
requests will be more likely to find them without searching, but it also means
that the most starred issues will tend to get more starred, since those issues
are shown to them more than others.  Just keep that in mind when you&#8217;re
evaluating issues based on their starred count.</p>
<p>The other view is grid view, and it is a very cool view that I really should use
more often. It lets you visualize issues in multiple dimensions, and can give
you a better feel for your issue distribution across status and other label
values. Here&#8217;s an example grid visualizing the status of issues across the
various Maps APIs. Immediately, I know which APIs need more triaging and
resources thrown at them.</p>

<p>It&#8217;s good to bookmark useful grid visualizations and revisit them once a month,
to spot trends or support needs. I will admit that I haven&#8217;t used grid view as
much as I should, so I don&#8217;t have further tips past that.</p>

<h4>Email notifications<a class="headerlink" href="#email-notifications" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The issue tracker lets you choose to send all notifications of issue activity
(new issues, changed issues, commented issues) to a particular address, and it
also lets you set rules to send label-dependent notifications to a particular
address. You can use this feature to make sure that issue changes are always
brought to the attention of a person and/or group of people.</p>
<p>The default settings is to not send to anyone:</p>
<p><img alt="notificationsdefault" src="_images/screenshot_issuetracking_notifications_default.png" /></p>
<p>This setting is okay if you are very religious about bug triages and do them on
a frequent basis, but as some filed bugs may in fact be quite urgent and need to
be addressed within hours, I recommend sending all bugs to some attentive
individual. You can also choose to send bugs to a Google Group, like one that
contains just your product team, or one that is a help forum for the actual
product. If you decide to send bugs to the latter, keep in mind that they can
become quite noisy, and may deter developers from subscribing to the group. It
very much depends on your particular developer community.</p>
<p>For the open source <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/gmaps-utility-library/">Maps API utility library</a>, I send all new issues to the
mailing list of project developers, and this makes the developers more likely to
pick up an issue and respond to it. For the Maps API, I send all issues to
myself, and then send API-specific issues to the relevant colleagues:</p>

<div class="section" id="homepage">
<h4>Homepage<a class="headerlink" href="#homepage" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>After you&#8217;ve spent all that time creating custom labels, templates, and
searches, you will want to make sure developers can find them easily. One thing
you can do is modify the home page of your project (in Administer-&gt;Project
Summary) to include all the relevant links.</p>
<p>For the Maps API, I list a section for each API, and then provide links to
browse bugs &amp; feature requests, and to file bugs &amp; feature requests. These links
address the most common reasons for developers coming to the issue tracker.</p>
<p><img alt="homepage" src="_images/screenshot_issuetracking_homepage.png" /></p>
<p>Some developers may ignore those links, click on the &#8220;Issues&#8221; tab, and be unsure
how to deal with the long list of issues in front of them. If you find
developers getting confused by that experience, you can replace the Issues tab
with a wiki page (in Administer-&gt;Tabs), and that wiki page can describe how
issue tracking works for your product. The <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/opensocial-resources/wiki/IssuesTab?tm=3">OpenSocial issue tracker</a> takes that
route:</p>
