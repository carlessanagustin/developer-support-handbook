<h1>Documentation<a class="headerlink" href="#documentation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>You can provide the best API in the world, but if you don&#8217;t
document it, the only developers that will use it are the ones that
are paid to do it, or that enjoy pain. Most likely, your goal is to
attract every type of developer - the hobbyists, the newbies, the
freelancers, the paid employees, the student, etc. - and the goal
of your documentation is to explain the API in a way that works for
all of those types of developers, and all types of learners.</p>
<p>Some developers learn best from an API reference, some from sample
code, some from a presentation, some from a conceptual guide. So,
you need to provide your documentation in all those different
forms, keeping them as up-to-date and in-sync with eachother as
possible.</p>
<p>A complete documentation set should try to include the following:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><a class="reference internal" href="#class-reference"><em>Class Reference</em></a>: A comprehensive listing of API functionality.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="#changelog"><em>Changelog</em></a>: A reference of what changes in each API version.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="#code-samples"><em>Code Samples</em></a>: A set of examples showing typical API usage.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="#code-playground"><em>Code Playground</em></a>: An interactive explorer for trying the API
live in the browser.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="#developers-guide"><em>Developers Guide</em></a>: A conversational written guide to using the API.</li>
<li><a class="reference internal" href="#articles"><em>Articles</em></a>: Tutorials and screencasts discussing different ways
of using the API.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="class-reference">
<span id="id1"></span><h2>Class Reference<a class="headerlink" href="#class-reference" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If your API is not open-source, then the class reference is the
absolute go-to source for showing developers what classes and
methods they can use. If your API is open-source (i.e. its a
non-obfuscated library of code), then this reference is a nice
alternative to grepping through code and looking for methods. A
reference can also be a great way to do a quick feature-check of an
API - just by a quick skim of the top-level classes in an API, a
developer can figure out if the API does what it wants it to do (or
not).</p>
<p>Your basic goals for a reference is to make sure it covers everything,
and is easy to search, link, and use.</p>
<div class="section" id="content">
<h3>Content<a class="headerlink" href="#content" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The reference should be thorough, covering every part of the API,
including versioning and deprecation information.</p>
<div class="section" id="full-coverage">
<h4>Full Coverage<a class="headerlink" href="#full-coverage" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The reference should show every aspect of an API - events,
properties, options, methods, classes, and constants. It should
also include every aspect of each of those. For example, a method
should have arguments, a return type, and a description. A property
should have the type and the default value, if there is one.</p>
<p>If any side effects result from a method, they should be described.
If any prerequisites are required before calling a method or using
a class, they should be described. For instance, developers using
the Maps API should always call <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">setCenter()</span></tt> after creating a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Map()</span></tt>
and before performing other actions, and we put notice of that in
both the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">Map()</span></tt> constructor and the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">setCenter()</span></tt> method.
(Sidenote: A better designed API would involve no prerequisites
like that.)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="versions">
<h4>Versions<a class="headerlink" href="#versions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>If your API has any notion of versions, and developers are able to
access different versions of the API at any given time, then the
reference should note the version differences in the reference.
Each API object should have the version it was introduced in its
description.</p>
<p>Ideally, a developer could also sort or filter a reference by
version. They might want to see every thing that was introduced in
version X, or see the most recently added objects.
Another alternative to denoting versions in the reference itself is
to provide different references for each versions. The downside to
providing a new reference for each version is that the URLs likely
change, and there may be a lot of redundant content if the API
doesn&#8217;t change much across versions.</p>
<p>The basic idea is to convey version information in your docs in
some way or the other.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="deprecation">
<h4>Deprecation<a class="headerlink" href="#deprecation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>If your API ever deprecates API objects, that should be very
clearly shown. In addition to including a &#8220;deprecated&#8221; or
&#8220;deprecated since version N&#8221; in the description, some visual
distinction should be employed, like greying out the section.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="format">
<h3>Format<a class="headerlink" href="#format" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>After you&#8217;ve made sure your reference covers everything,
you should optimize the format to make it easy to find
and reference everything.</p>
<div class="section" id="number-of-pages">
<h4>Number of Pages<a class="headerlink" href="#number-of-pages" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>There is one big decision to make when figuring out the format of
your reference, and that affects all of the requirements: one page
or multiple pages.</p>
<p>The benefit of providing a one-page reference is that a developer can
easily do a quick CTRL+F to jump around the reference.
The downside is that the reference can grow pretty large as your
API grows, which means you can&#8217;t safely sprinkle it with
images or interactive items and expect it to load in a reasonable
amount of time time.</p>
<p>If possible, you could offer both options. For the Flash Maps API,
we host a single-page version online, and we distribute a
multi-page traditional ASDoc format along in the SDK zip, so people
can choose what they prefer. The single-page version is generated
from the multi-page doc, so we can keep them in sync automatically.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="linkable">
<h4>Linkable<a class="headerlink" href="#linkable" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Every API object in your reference should be addressable by a
unique URL - e.g. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">#map.MapOptions.draggable</span></tt> for a single page
reference or <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">map/MapOptions.html#draggable</span></tt> for a multi-page
reference. The primary purpose of this is so that each API object
can be referred to directly when communicating in forums, blog posts,
articles, and the rest of the documentation.</p>
<p>In addition to being linkable, the reference needs to provide an
easy way for developers to find that URL (so that they don&#8217;t have to
hunt through the HTML looking for anchor tags). We accomplish that in the
JS Maps API by hyperlinking the API object name. Another option
would be to put a little link icon next to each API object section.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="searchable">
<h4>Searchable<a class="headerlink" href="#searchable" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>A developer should be able to search through a reference and find
what they want quickly. If your reference is single-page, that&#8217;s
accomplished with CTRL+F (browser find). If not, then you should
provide a reference-specific search box. That could be implemented
using a Google Custom Search Engine scoped to the reference pages.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="downloadable">
<h4>Downloadable<a class="headerlink" href="#downloadable" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Surprisingly, even though its hard to develop with Web APIs while
offline, there are developers out there that like to browse through
references while they&#8217;re flying on a plane, tanning on a beach in
Maui, etc. For those developers, you can provide a PDF version of
your reference, or perhaps use HTML5 offline storage to make your
reference available offline. Just always make sure that the
downloadable version stays in-sync with the live version - and if
that isn&#8217;t possible, then I suggest only offering the live version.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="generation">
<h3>Generation<a class="headerlink" href="#generation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>As you can see, there are a lot of requirements to a good
reference. And really, you don&#8217;t want to have to worry about all of
them each time that you update the reference after an API change.
Ideally, you should generate the reference programmatically from
the updated code, and the reference generator should adhere to the
requirements.</p>
<p>JavaDoc was the first tool to make this easy, for turning Java into
multi-page references, and many tools have followed suit for the
other languages.</p>
<div class="section" id="jsdoc-toolkit">
<h4>JSdoc-toolkit<a class="headerlink" href="#jsdoc-toolkit" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/jsdoc-toolkit/">JsDoc Toolkit</a> runs over JavaScript source code and generates single-page
or multi-page HTML from it. It can also generate other text formats,
like JSON and XML, via custom templates.</p>
<p>When we decided we wanted to auto-generate the <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/reference.html">Maps API v3 reference</a>
(after experiencing the pain of manually updating the reference for v2),
we decided to use the toolkit, and I endeavored to customize the output
for our needs.</p>
<p>The toolkit is great in concept, but it takes a fair amount of fiddling
with, depending on how you format your JavaScript code (the Google coding
conventions differ somewhat the standard), and on how much you want
to customize the output.</p>
<p>Ironically enough, the toolkit is written in JS, but its own code contains
very little comments, so it can be frustrating to debug. If you do
decide to use <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/jsdoc-toolkit/">JsDoc Toolkit</a> and you are looking for an output similar to
our one-page API references, you can download <a class="reference external" href="http://gmaps-utility-library-dev.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/util/docs/template/">the template</a>
from our open source Maps API library.</p>
<p><img alt="mapsv3reference" src="_images/screenshot_mapsv3reference.png" /></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="pydoc">
<h4>PyDoc<a class="headerlink" href="#pydoc" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://docs.python.org/library/pydoc.html">pydoc</a> Python module runs over Python code and produces a multi-page
format similar to JavaDoc. The result is highly linkable, but as it is
multi-page, it&#8217;s harder to search. In addition, the default output is not
too aesthetically pleasing.</p>
<p>Google currently uses this for the Google data <a class="reference external" href="http://gdata-python-client.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pydocs/gdata.html">Python client library</a>
reference.</p>
<p><img alt="gdatareference" src="_images/screenshot_pydoc.png" /></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="sphinx">
<h4>Sphinx<a class="headerlink" href="#sphinx" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://sphinx.pocoo.org/">Sphinx</a> tool makes it easy to create documentation for source
code (or in fact, any text) that uses <a class="reference external" href="http://sphinx.pocoo.org/rest.html">reStructuredText</a>-style formatting.
It was originally created to generate the documentation for the
new Python documentation, so Python developers will recognize its
defalt output immediately, but it is also being used to output
documentation for other languages, and non-code documentation, like
this handbook itself.</p>
<p><a class="reference external" href="http://sphinx.pocoo.org/">Sphinx</a> allows you to mix reference information
with other content, like textual explanations, so it can be a nice
way to write an entire developers guide. You can use it to create
one-page or multi-page references (with the tendency towards the
first), and the default output looks nice and clean. Additionally,
you can easily output other formats, like LaTex or PDF, by just
running a different command on your source files.</p>
<p>If you are not already using reStructuredText for your code,
it can take some time to learn the format and port the comments over,
but particularly for Python APIs, it&#8217;s worth the time.</p>
<p>After starting with pydoc, we switched over to using Sphinx for the
<a class="reference external" href="http://wave-robot-python-client.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/pydocs/index.html">Wave Robots API Python library</a> reference.</p>
<p><img alt="wavereference" src="_images/screenshot_wavereference.png" /></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="asdoc">
<h4>ASDoc<a class="headerlink" href="#asdoc" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h4>
<p>Adobe provides <a class="reference external" href="http://livedocs.adobe.com/flex/3/html/help.html?content=asdoc_1.html">ASDoc</a> to make it easier for developers
to create multi-page references like the ones that they host on
their site. Since ActionScript developers already use this format
when they&#8217;re using core AS3 libraries, it&#8217;s a good, familiar format
to choose if you&#8217;re providing your own AS3 library.</p>
<p>We used ASDoc to create a downloadable multi-page reference for the
Flash Maps API, and we used a script to convert that into an online
one-page reference othat looked more like our other APIs.
We were trying to be both consistent with what Flash developers
were used to, and with what Maps API developers were used to, since
we expected developers to be coming from both fronts.</p>
<p><img alt="flashreference" src="_images/screenshot_flashreference.png" /></p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="changelog">
<span id="id6"></span><h2>Changelog<a class="headerlink" href="#changelog" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When documenting your API, you must also document when and how your API
changes. A changelog should list changes in behavior, new API objects,
and deprecated API objects, with links to relevant sections of the reference
or blog posts. It should also list any developer-facing bugs that were fixed,
and link to an issue tracker, if the bug was tracked there.</p>
<p>For the Maps APIs, we post the changelogs as <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/gmaps-api-issues/w/list">wiki pages</a> in
the issue tracker project. That makes it easy to link to the
changed issues, and also comes with an RSS feed, so developers can
subscribe to any changes in the changelog wikis if desired.
(Note: You should be also posting about changes to an announcements list).</p>
<p>Other Google APIs post their changelogs as pages in the documentation,
such as the <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/apis/analytics/docs/gdata/changelog.html">Google Analytics Data Export API</a> and <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/apis/sites/changelog.html">Google Sites API</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="analyticschangelog" src="_images/screenshot_analyticschangelog.png" /></p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="code-samples">
<span id="id7"></span><h2>Code Samples<a class="headerlink" href="#code-samples" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It is great to explain the concepts behind an API and list all its objects
in a reference,  but when it comes down to actually using the API, nothing
beats sample code. If a developer can see a bit of code, and know that the
code works to produce the desired result, then they can immediately plug
that into their code and modify as needed.</p>
<p>Now, unfortunately, there are some developers that are very good at
copying-and-pasting sample code word-for-word, and are useless to do anything
with it after - and basically ask developers in the forum to write the rest of
the code for them. So, there is a danger to having good sample code &#8211;
attracting developers that don&#8217;t bother to actually learn the API &#8211;
but the benefits outweigh the risk.</p>
<p>Good sample code should demonstrate actual (non-theoretical) uses
of the API, should be commented, should be licensed appropriately
(e.g. Apache). It should be runnable - developers should be able to
prove that it works, before using it themselves. It be linkable and
searchable, like the rest of the documentation. And, if you really
want to be able to scale up your repository of code samples, you
should have a way of showcasing samples created by external
developers.</p>
<p>We have a couple different ways of showcasing code samples across
Google APIs.</p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/demogallery.html">Maps API demo gallery</a> is a single page that uses JavaScript
to pull data from a published Google Spreadsheet and lets
developers search and browse through the demos.</p>
<p>It is linkable and searchable, but since it&#8217;s entirely AJAX-driven, it is not
indexed by web spiders. This means that developers need to know
that the demo gallery exists before they can search for demos
that answer their questions. Based on the number of times that I
responded to forum posts with a quick search in the gallery, my
conclusion is that most developers do not know that it exists
or think to look there.</p>
<p>Another drawback to this format is that a Googler must enter in the
information about each sample, which takes a certain amount of time
and means that the gallery does not easily scale to many samples.</p>
<p><img alt="mapsgallery" src="_images/screenshot_mapsdemogallery.png" /></p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://wave-samples-gallery.appspot.com/">Wave Samples Gallery</a> is an App Engine app (and <a class="reference external" href="http://google-wave-resources.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/samples-gallery/">open-sourced</a>).
Any developer can sign in, and fill out a form to submit a sample.
That goes into a moderation queue, and a group of moderators is sent an email.
We check it out, and with just a click of a button, we can approve
it for display in the gallery. Then, each sample has its own page,
and each author has its own page, and the whole app is fully indexable
by web spiders (and that indexing is enhanced by a generated robots.txt).</p>
<p>One tricky issue is searchability within the app itself, as App Engine
does not yet enable full-text search over the datastore by default.
To workaround this, the app offers the ability to filter by tags,
and then embeds a Google custom search widget for full-text search.</p>
<p>This approach meant that we could grow from a small number of samples
to a large number quite easily (and given the initial excitement over the
Wave APIs, that&#8217;s what ended up happening). However, that growability
has its drawbacks. First, it can be hard to decide what actually belongs
in the gallery, and what to reject. A particular sample may not show off
something that is interesting to you, but it may be interesting to someone else
out there. Second, when you&#8217;ve grown your samples gallery substantially,
it becomes harder for developers to find the quintessential samples &#8211;
the simple ones that are the easiest for them to get started with.
To help remedy that, we added &#8220;Best Practices&#8221; and &#8220;By Googler&#8221;
filters to the samples gallery, but it is not a perfect solution.</p>
<p><img alt="wavegallery" src="_images/screenshot_wavesamplesgallery.png" /></p>
<p>Some APIs, like the <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/apis/gdata/samples.html">Google Data APIs</a>, simply include a single-page
list of Googler-created samples. This can work for a simple API
with a smaller number of use cases or developers.</p>
<p><img alt="gdatagallery" src="_images/screenshot_googledatasamples.png" /></p>
<p>When figuring out what format to use for your API, consider carefully
whether developers would benefit more from a short curated list or
from a diverse range of examples, and in all cases, ensure your
solution is searchable and linkable.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="code-playground">
<span id="id8"></span><h2>Code Playground<a class="headerlink" href="#code-playground" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It can sometimes be a lot of work for a developer to setup an
environment to start using a particular API &#8211; sometimes, it&#8217;s so
much work that they don&#8217;t ever do it. If a developer can start
playing with API code live on your site, without any setup at all, and
see what the code results in, then they&#8217;re more likely to get
excited about an API and put in the effort to start
using it. That&#8217;s why interactive code playgrounds are a nice
complement to documentation.</p>
<p>Depending on whether you have a client-side, server-side, or HTTP
API, the playground come in different forms. For the AJAX APIs,
including the Maps API and nearly 20 other APIs, we provide the
<a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/apis/ajax/playground">Google Code Playground</a>. Using this playground, the developer can
choose a particular sample from the left hand-side, preview the result
of the code, edit the
code, and save or export when they&#8217;re done. That way, they can get
started in the playground and migrate to their own environment when
they&#8217;re ready, with very little work. This playground runs on App
Engine, and the code is open-sourced in the <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/google-ajax-examples/source/browse/#svn/trunk/interactive_samples">google-ajax-examples repository</a>,
so that other APIs can re-use it for their own purposes &#8211; like
Google&#8217;s own <a class="reference external" href="http://playground.html5rocks.com/">HTML5 playground</a> or the non-Google <a class="reference external" href="http://mapstraction.appspot.com/">Mapstraction playground</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="ajaxplayground" src="_images/screenshot_ajaxplayground.png" /></p>
<p>For some of the Google data APIs, which are HTTP-based, Google offers
several interactive apps for interacting with the protocol. The
<a class="reference external" href="http://googlecodesamples.com/oauth_playground/">OAuth playground</a> makes it easy to retrieve an authentication token
for a particular API, and then do GET or POST requests on particular URLs.
This playground both aids developers in previewing API results before
writing their own code, and in debugging the OAuth flow in their
own application, which can be tricky. That playground is
open-sourced in the <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/gdata-samples/source/browse/#svn/trunk/oauth_playground">gdata-samples repository</a>,
and could be reused by other OAuth-based API offerings.</p>
<p><img alt="oauthplayground" src="_images/screenshot_oauthplayground.png" /></p>
<p>One of my favorite non-Google playground offerings is the
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/explore/?method=flickr.photos.search">Flickr API explorer</a>,
which wraps on top of their XML-RPC APIs, letting you specify all
the different parameters and previewing the resulting XML in the
browser. As a bonus, it even provides developers with suggested values
for the parameters, based on their own photosets. Whenever I&#8217;m using the
Flickr API and wondering if I can do something or how I can do it,
I always hit up that Flickr API explorer first.</p>
<p><img alt="flickrexplorer" src="_images/screenshot_flickrexplorer.png" /></p>
<p>Playgrounds serve many purposes - they are great ways to get
developers hooked, they make it easier to test and debug an API,
and they are also fantastic devices for teaching and demonstrating
APIs. Regardless of the reason you pick, they&#8217;re a great addition
to any set of documentation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="developers-guide">
<span id="id9"></span><h2>Developers Guide<a class="headerlink" href="#developers-guide" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>A developer&#8217;s guide is a walkthrough of how to use the API -
it&#8217;s like how a teacher would explain the API to their students,
but it&#8217;s penned down in digital ink (and there&#8217;s no talking back!).
Some of those students will be new to the API, some will be new
to web development entirely, and some will be old pros -
the guide should work for all of them.</p>
<p>At the minimum, a guide should demonstrate how to get started using
the API, bringing the developer from zero knowledge to a working piece of code.
If they can get to that minimal working piece of code, then they will feel
much more motivated to continue exploring the API using just the reference.</p>
<p>If possible, a guide can walk through <em>all</em> of the aspects of using the API,
for the developers that learn the best through the instructional format.</p>
<p><img alt="mapsdevguide" src="_images/screenshot_mapsdevguide.png" /></p>
<p>The <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/documentation/javascript/basics.html">Maps API Developer&#8217;s Guide</a> is an example of a comprehensive guide.
For every aspect of the API, there is a corresponding page in the guide that describes
how that part of the API works. On the opposite end of the spectrum, the Flickr API
provides only a <a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.overview.html">few paragraphs</a> about how their HTTP API works, and then sends
you off to the API explorer to actually start using it.
A comprehensive guide is likely  more necessary for a JavaScript API
than for an HTTP API, since a JS API can vary in how the different
parts of it are used, whereas an HTTP API
is typically the same request/response pattern for every action.
(Note that Flickr does provide additional documentation on
<a class="reference external" href="http://www.flickr.com/services/api/misc.userauth.html">user authentication</a>, a topic that is not as straightforward as HTTP requests.</p>
<p>Regardless of length, the guide should link to other aspects of the
documentation - the reference, the samples, the playground, the articles
- so that developers understand that those resources exist, and will hopefully
explore them independently in the future.</p>

<div class="section" id="articles">

<p>While a developer&#8217;s guide should walk a developer through the basic
usage of an API and its functionality, it can&#8217;t cover every
possible use of that API in a coherent way. That is where articles
and tutorials come in, to teach developers tangential or
specialized uses of an API, like combining it with another service,
framework, or API.</p>
<p>For example, the most popular articles that I ever wrote for the
Maps API were about combining it with PHP &amp; MySQL. I started with
a <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/articles/phpsqlajax.html">basic article</a> on rendering markers from a database on a map, and after
I saw the number of developers reading that article (both from the analytics
and forum posts), I started writing related articles, and linking
them back and forth to eachother to form a pseudo-series.</p>
<p>Articles vary in form - some are like tutorials that step you from
beginning to a final output (like the PHP/MySQL tutorial), some are
a collection of tips, like <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/apis/wave/articles/robotdebugging.html">Debugging Wave Robots</a>,
and some can be screencasts visually demonstrating a process, like
<a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/apis/maps/articles/debuggingmaps.html">Using Debugging Tools with the Maps API</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="screencast" src="_images/screenshot_mapsscreencast.png" /></p>
<p>Each of those formats appeal to a different developer and work for
different content, and it&#8217;s a good thing to experiment with the
different formats and see what works for your audience and API.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re lucky, you will see many external developers writing
their own articles and tutorials. If you can, you should try to
collect links to those articles, and provide them from your own
documentation (denoting that they&#8217;re non-official). It&#8217;s good for
the authors because it gives them more traffic to their site,
making them feel appreciated and more likely to write more, and
it&#8217;s good for developers because it gives them additional resources
to explore, written from different viewpoints. To manage this, I
typically bookmark any external article I see from my alerts or
twitter streams, and once a month, add them to our articles page
and blog about them.</p>
<p>According to my analytics on our API documentation sites,
developers are less likely to visit the articles section than the
main developer&#8217;s guide, maybe because they assume they&#8217;ll find
their answers in the &#8220;main&#8221; documentation. To increase the chance
of a developer encountering an article, I recommend sprinkling the
documentation with links to relevant articles, where it makes
sense.</p>
