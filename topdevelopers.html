<h1>Top Developers<a class="headerlink" href="#top-developers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>It&#8217;s important to both <strong>know of</strong> your top developers, in the
sense that you can rattle off a list of them from your head (or
perhaps from a mechanized system), and also to <strong>know</strong> your developers
in the sense that you have 1-on-1 contact with them and feel
comfortable calling them an acquaintance or even a friend.</p>
<p>Once you know who your top developers are, you can use them to make
a better API and a better community. You can ask them for advice
about the future of the API (perhaps formally, in a trusted testers
forum), and you can sometimes even suggest useful sample code for them to
create and give back to the community. But, before you can get to
all that, you first need to find out <a class="reference internal" href="#finding-them"><em>who they are</em></a>,
<a class="reference internal" href="#contacting-them"><em>reach out to them</em></a>, and
<a class="reference internal" href="#rewarding-them"><em>reward them</em></a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="developer-types">
<span id="finding-them"></span><h2>Developer Types<a class="headerlink" href="#developer-types" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are different types of top developers, and different places
you can find them.</p>
<div class="section" id="the-forum-posters">
<h3>The Forum Posters<a class="headerlink" href="#the-forum-posters" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The most obvious top developers (atleast to someone who spends most
of their support time in forums) are the ones that are also the top
posters in the forum. They typically have websites hosting sample
code, and they respond to questions in the forum with pointers to
their own code with the answer. Not only are they great developers,
they&#8217;re usually also very good at formulating answers in a way that
makes sense and actually teaches the querying newbie (instead of
just writing the answer for them). They&#8217;re the kind of people that
you would hire to do your job, if only you ever had the headcount
to hire a support army.</p>
<p>To find these top developers, take a look at who the top posters in
the forum are and evaluate the quality of their responses. It&#8217;s
simple to see who the top posters are in most forums. In Google
Groups, you can click &#8220;About this Group&#8221; and see the top posters of
all-time and also the top posters of the month. The top posters of
the month is useful for seeing who&#8217;s the most active in recent
times - and perhaps to find up-and-coming top posters, and to
nurture them, and the top posters of all-time is useful for seeing
who has stuck by the API through the ages, and will be your
rocks. Try to also find those developers that may not post often,
but when they do, it&#8217;s on a topic that noone else understands and
they give very lucid answers. It&#8217;s not easy to programmatically
find this sort - it requires actually seeing posts in the forum,
and paying attention when you see a very helpful post attributed to
an infrequent poster.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-article-writers">
<h3>The Article Writers<a class="headerlink" href="#the-article-writers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Some developers also have been blessed with the skill (and desire)
for technical writing. They can take a technical topic that they
love, and they can either explain the basics of it in a way that
appeals to everyone (and perhaps is better than even the
documentation for some), or they can explain an
advanced topic that is particular to their work. Article writers
would likely make great forum posters as well, but it seems they
often choose to funnel their words into larger pieces instead of
short answers (but hey, if you can get an article writer to
cross-over, do it!).</p>
<p>To find article writers, you need to find the
articles that they write. I find most articles via Google Alerts
and Twitter searches for our API, but I also find some of them
through solicitation. In the articles section in the documentation
we also link to externally written articles, and at the bottom,
we provide a link (spreadsheet form) to submit content.
Theoretically, this link may also encourage developers with writing
skills to consider writing an article, even if they hadn&#8217;t already.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="the-book-writers">
<h3>The Book Writers<a class="headerlink" href="#the-book-writers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The article writers sometimes turn into full-on book writers. I
have a massive respect for the book writers in this world. Books
are rather long, and printed on paper, and I have never had the
confidence to write a book about a technical topic because I fear
that it will be outdated by the time I finally finished it. But
there are people out there without that fear, and they write great
books, and I am thankful for that. Even when books may technically
cover the same topic space as the documentation, they can approach
it from an entirely different angle, and this can make the book a
valuable read.</p>
<p>For example, <cite>Sterling Udell</cite>, one of the top posters for the
Google Mapplets forum, wrote
a book about using <cite>KML in Maps Mashups and Mapplets</cite>. His book was
about a fairly niche technical topic, but he approached it from the
angle of assuming no web programming knowledge, and that made it
far more interesting. He made great analogies like comparing
JavaScript objects to &#8220;folders on a desktop&#8221; - and it was for those
kind of simple analogies that I ended up recommending that all of
our not-as-technical marketing team members read this book, and
re-using his anologies when I was teaching JavaScript to
non-programmers. Never assume that your audience will always be
experts in the prerequisite technologies (JavaScript, Python, etc)
- sometimes they&#8217;ll be non-programmers that are so enticed by the
possibilities of your API that they are determined to use it
regardless. So, it is useful to have resources that teach your API
from this angle, like that book.</p>
<p>Most book writers will want a technical contact on the actual API
team to review their book before submission, and this is how I&#8217;ve
found out about most of the books on the topic.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="open-source-contributors">
<h3>Open Source Contributors<a class="headerlink" href="#open-source-contributors" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Some developers just write damn nifty code, and bless their heart,
they like to open-source it as well. These developers might host
their code on standalone projects on github, sourceforge, or
googlecode.com, and it can be hard to find them - both for you and
for API developers searching for useful code. To make it easier
for everyone, I suggest either creating a directory of related
open-source libraries, or even creating a single open-source project
for the majority of them.</p>
<p>For each of the Google Maps APIs, we manage a <cite>utility library</cite>
Google code project.
On the surface, it is a single project, but in reality, it is
a collection of multiple libraries hosted in the same project,
and conforming to a consistent set of coding and documentation styles.
By encouraging the open-source developers out there to
all contribute their offerings to the central library, I have
a very easy way of keeping track of them, and I get to know
them better through reviews of their contributions.</p>
<p>To encourage developers to join the project, we provide a prominent
link about joining on the main project page and in every blog
post that announces a new library release. Of course, there are some
developers out there who go at it on their own - either because they have some
preference for their own individual hosting solution (perhaps due
to licensing issues), or because they are unaware of the existing
open source utility library. When I discovered relevant open source
projects in the wild, I would contact the author and see if they wanted to join.
Sometimes they were, sometimes they weren&#8217;t, but it didn&#8217;t hurt to make contact.</p>
<p>jQuery takes the directory approach for <a href="#id1"><span class="problematic" id="id2">`third-party plugins`_</span></a>, letting
developers submit information about their plugins to the central gallery,
and providing gallery extras like ratings, filters, and search.
This approach is more scalable, and as jQuery is the most popular JavaScript
framework in the world, it benefits them to have a scalable approach.
It also means less opportunities for one-on-one contact with the open-source developers,
but the jQuery developers likely know eachother through mailing lists
and other means.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="paid-employees">
<h3>Paid Employees<a class="headerlink" href="#paid-employees" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>There are also people out there that are actually paid to use your
API on a daily basis, as a part of their full-time job. Sometimes
you discover these developers through the above pathways, but I
find it&#8217;s not as common for paid employees to be posting in the
forums (they&#8217;re often conscious about giving away information about what
they&#8217;re working on) or contributing to open-source (there are often
too many legal hurdles to doing that).</p>
<p>On the Maps API, I met most of the &#8220;paid employees&#8221; when they
emailed me to request more quota for their company. You see, our API
placed a quota on the number of HTTP geocoder requests out there,
and the larger sites out there often require a larger quota.
If they&#8217;re an Enterprise API customer, they automatically get
the larger quota, but if not, they have to request (beg) for more.
Those request emails helped form some of the most invaluable (and random)
connections, and also helped me know about the up-and-coming
great mapping websites before anyone else.
The email-Pamela was admittedly a rather primitive system for
requesting more quota, and will likely be replaced with something
more automated in the future - but it was a great system for meeting
developers that I wouldn&#8217;t have otherwise.</p>
<p>If it is possible with your API and
doesn&#8217;t make the API painful/prohibitive to use, put a (high) limit
on something, and require serious developers to contact you to get it
lifted. You might get a few crap requests, but you&#8217;ll get some good
ones as well.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, the Google Maps API also comes in an Enterprise
flavor, for companies that want to pay for different terms, an SLA,
and various other reasons. We occasionally held training or consulting
meetings with Enterprise API users, and I would meet their developers
that way. When you meet developers formally like that, it&#8217;s a bit harder
to form good (friendly, casual) relations. I often looked for an excuse
to go out for a drink with them, to forge a more normal
relationship than the men-in-suits-shaking-hands kind.
When people are paying you money to use your API, they&#8217;ll likely
stick around for a while, so it helps to be on good (great) terms
with eachother.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="outreach">
<span id="contacting-them"></span><h2>Outreach<a class="headerlink" href="#outreach" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Okay, so now you know where to find the top developers across the
spectrum of your API developers. Now, you need to get to know them.</p>
<p>In the cases where you find your top developers in the forums or
wandering around the web, you should shoot them an introduction
email. That email should introduce yourself (if it&#8217;s not obvious),
thank them profusely for their community contribution or recognize
the great work they&#8217;ve put out there, and then perhaps ask them how
they came to use your API. The purpose is just to get some
conversation going, and hopefully within a few email exchanges,
you&#8217;ll be buddy-buddy.</p>
<p>If you actually find yourself in the same city as them and you have
the time and willingness, then you can invite them for drinks or
perhaps a meal at your office where you can introduce them to relevant
colleagues. You could also invite a group of developers out together,
so you can meet them <em>and</em> they can meet eachother. (Just be wary
of inviting competitors - we once had a showdown between the two top
real estate Maps API sites when they found themself in a networking lunch
together!)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tokens-of-appreciation">
<span id="rewarding-them"></span><h2>Tokens of Appreciation<a class="headerlink" href="#tokens-of-appreciation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In addition to offering your gratitude in your contact email,
you would ideally offer a more tangible expression of your gratitude.
There are a few ways that you can reward developers:</p>
<div class="section" id="schwag">
<h3>Schwag<a class="headerlink" href="#schwag" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Free stuff! But more importantly, free stuff with your brand
name or logo, free stuff that they can&#8217;t get just anywhere.</p>
<p>In the Google Developer relations group, we have a full stockpile of Google schwag
for random occassions - mugs, water bottles, and stress relievers,
all with the Google logo. We also have some more
developer-specific schwag: t-shirts with QR codes that point to our
developer website, stuffed Android dolls, hooded sweatshirts with &#8220;API GURU&#8221;
written on them, and, my favorite, magnetic poetry with our APIs as the poetry
parts. That&#8217;s the stuff they can&#8217;t get anywhere else, and the stuff
that lets them show off their nerdy Google-loving self.</p>
<p>If you pick one schwag item to stock up on, make it t-shirts. <em>Everyone</em>
loves free t-shirts (well, except for this one guy who only wore
Polos). Plus, from the marketing perspective, t-shirts are great
free publicity for your brand. If you don&#8217;t quite have the budget
for shirts, stock up on cheaper items like stickers and pens.</p>
<p>When you email the developer, explain that you&#8217;d like to offer them some
free schwag as a small token of your appreciation, and ask for
their t-shirt size and address. Then, put together a care package
of schwag and include a short hand-written thank you letter. It&#8217;s a
great way to live out the fantasy of being the mum of a kid at
summer camp, without all those pregnancy and child-rearing
complications. :)</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="guest-blog">
<h3>Guest Blog<a class="headerlink" href="#guest-blog" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If your API has a blog (as it should), then you can use that blog
to highlight the work of your top developers, and give them a place
to show their portfolio or company. The key is to not let the blog
post become simply an advertisement - it should primarily provide
technical insight (or better, code) that other developers can learn from.
A highly technical guest blog post is a great way to feature an
up-and-coming startup.</p>
<p>On the Maps API, we&#8217;ve had some great guest blog posts from
our top developers (and some fairly big companies), like  <a class="reference external" href="http://googlegeodevelopers.blogspot.com/2009/06/travellr-behind-scenes-of-our-region.html">Travellr</a>,
<a class="reference external" href="http://googlemapsapi.blogspot.com/2008/03/orbitz-mobile-traffic-maps-static-maps.html">Orbitz</a>, <a class="reference external" href="http://googlegeodevelopers.blogspot.com/2008/07/using-static-maps-and-http-geocoding-to.html">LonelyPlanet</a>, and <a class="reference external" href="http://googlegeodevelopers.blogspot.com/2008/08/using-google-maps-to-visualize-arcgis.html">ArcGIS</a>.</p>
<p><img alt="orbitzblog" src="_images/screenshot_orbitzblog.png" /></p>
<p>In the Maps API open source library, the release process wiki
actually includes writing a blog post as one of the release steps,
and provides <a class="reference external" href="http://code.google.com/p/gmaps-utility-library-dev/wiki/BlogPostGuidelines">posting guidelines</a> for them to follow.
We encourage them to start their posts with a bio and a photo,
and it helps us put a face to an otherwise large and
faceless API developer community. For example, check out
the <cite>Marker Tracker launch post</cite> from a startup developer.</p>
<p><img alt="markertrackerblog" src="_images/screenshot_markertrackerblog.png" /></p>
<p>When done right, a guest blog post should be a win-win: the developer benefits
from increased traffic to their site or increased
requests for freelance development, and the API team benefits
from having an informative blog post.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="trusted-testers">
<h3>Trusted Testers<a class="headerlink" href="#trusted-testers" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>A trusted testers program is basically a way of sharing new
features (or entire new APIs) with a limited set of NDA&#8217;d
developers. This set of developers should mostly be your top
developers, plus probably some developers that are paying to use
your product and need to see what&#8217;s coming so they can plan their
year.</p>
<p>The hope is that a top developer in a trusted tester program will
give feedback to you (bugs/features), create demos, write articles,
and code extensions. Basically, the hope is that they&#8217;ll do
everything they usually do with your API, but they&#8217;ll do it using
the new features. In addition, if that developer is an active forum
contributor, they should hopefully be one of the main developers
answering questions about the new stuff in the main forum once it&#8217;s
launched. If you can launch an API or feature set with the support
community already built up, then you&#8217;ve done yourself a massive
favor - trust me, it can take months/years to build up a forum
support community.</p>
<p>The benefit to the API team here is obvious &#8211; we get feedback
before the feature is out, and we can tweak it without having to
worry about maintaining backwards compatibility, and then we get
accompanying resources showing how to use it, for free. The benefit
to the developer depends on their interests in the API &#8211; if
they&#8217;re a freelance developer, it may give them a leg up in getting
jobs (as they can list that they&#8217;re a trusted tester on their
resume), and if they work for a company, it may help them
streamline their efforts (perhaps it&#8217;s a feature that they&#8217;ve been
waiting on for months).</p>
<p>We had our first trusted tester program when we were creating Maps
API v3. Though we didn&#8217;t get a flood of critical feedback about the
API, the developers were quick to create demos and extensions. When
we launched, we had X external demos in our gallery, and we were
able to show those off at conferences and in the launch blog post.
One developer, Gabriel Svennerberg, even wrote a few articles and
revealed that he was working on a book using Maps API v3. It turned
out that it was crucial that we had invited him to the trusted
tester program when we did, as it was at that exact time that he
was planning the topic of his book.</p>
<p>Since the Maps API v3 trusted tester program was successful, we
decided to create one for testing our Flash API 3d perspective
view. It was interesting figuring out who to invite to this
program, as I didn&#8217;t really have an established set of Flash API
developers. The Flash API had only been out a year, and I&#8217;m sad to
admit that a Flash API community
never really built up. So, I invited some of the recently more
active forum posters, all of the Flash open source library authors,
some developers that had written blog posts about the API, and some
Japanese developers that had done some crazy awesome demos (there&#8217;s
something in the sake in that country). Since we had pre-announced
that we were working on a Flash API 3d perspective, I could also
talk about it at events and find interested developers that way. I
once tweeted that we were hacking at work on the
3d flash perspective, and found a few more developers through
replies. This set of developers created an amazing set of demos
with the API, and more importantly, did things with the API that we
never even thought of, and got us even more excited about the new
feature. I&#8217;d say that we got even more feedback from this group
than we got from the Maps API v3 group, and I suspect that&#8217;s
because we gave them something entirely new to play with, instead
of just a rewrite of an existing API. If you can give your trusted
developers something different to play with, then I suspect you&#8217;ll
see more of them trying it out and reporting back.

</div>
<div class="section" id="linking">
<h3>Linking<a class="headerlink" href="#linking" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Sometimes all you need to do to honor the work of a developer is to
link to it from the appropriate place. For the Maps API, we have
links to demos (samples with source code that&#8217;s easy to view and
easy to learn from) in the demo gallery, and links to articles in
the articles section. For websites that are very cool uses of the
API but aren&#8217;t simple enough demos, we can include that in a
featured project feed that is displayed on our API landing page.
For all of those types of links, we can also tweet it from our
official API account, and hope that our followers enjoy them and
even re-tweet them. You never know what will go viral, so tweet
everything relevant. Once you&#8217;ve linked or tweeted something or
both, let the developer know about it. They&#8217;ll appreciate you
sharing the resource, and also understand where new traffic is
coming from.</p>
